&lt;p&gt;I feel I must begin with a confession: I was not an early adopter of PowerShell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began using PowerShell because I had no other choice. I needed to manage the Live@EDU environment at the college where I worked. Who had time to learn something that was only going to be used with that particular setup? Not this guy. Boy, was I wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more I needed to do with my environment, the more PowerShell quietly raised its hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2010, I took on the challenge of forcing myself to learn PowerShell by way of converting a complex set of VBScript scripts into PowerShell. In a few short weeks, perhaps with a couple all-nighters, I had crafted a replacement solution that connected to Orcale, Microsoft SQL, and MySQL databases. It interfaced with Active Directory, Live@EDU, and Sun One LDAP. It used a .Net log4j logging and dot sourced modularized code (some of which were my own functions). It was an amazing homebrew identity management solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each year after that, my PowerShell skills grew and grew. I had/have a PowerShell session open basically all of the time. As much as I could, I tried using PowerShell commands instead of the GUI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2012, I started working with someone that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ILovePowerShell.com&quot;&gt;loved PowerShell&lt;/a&gt; as much as I did. We challenged each other and learned from it. I wrote functions and dot-sourced them in my profile. I started dabbling in modules, but just didn’t make the time to delve fully into them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last couple years, I switched from PowerShell ISE to VS Code, started using git repositories (internal and GitHub), and created my first few real modules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’ve decided to start blogging about PowerShell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ve had the domain &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;anovelidea.org&lt;/code&gt; since early 2000. If you want a break from PowerShell and IT in general, you can check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.anovelidea.org&quot;&gt;my other website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Dave Carroll</name></author><summary type="html">Greetings fellow PowerShell aficionados!
