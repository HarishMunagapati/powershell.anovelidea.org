In a few short weeks, perhaps with a couple all-nighters, I had crafted a replacement solution that connected to Orcale, Microsoft SQL, and MySQL databases. It interfaced with Active Directory, Live@EDU, and Sun One LDAP. It used a .Net log4j logging and dot sourced modularized code (some of which were my own functions).
