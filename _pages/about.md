I'm just a systems dude with an aptitude for Active Directory and scripting. I also like data, finding data, and fixing data, often with my tool of choice, PowerShell.

I've gravitated toward automation & DevOps, but I do not really have a development background. I have written lots of scripts in bash, batch, vbscript, PHP, and, my favorite, PowerShell.

I switched to VS Code in late 2016 from PowerShell ISE. And, this year I started my GitHub presence and I am venturing down the CI/CD path.

Hope you find my posts informative and entertaining.
