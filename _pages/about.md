Regarding Dave Carroll
{: style="text-align: center"}

I'm just a dude with a knack for finding data (and faults in data). Often, my tool of choice is PowerShell.

I've gravitated toward automation & DevOps, but I do not really have a development background. I have written lots of scripts in bash, batch, vbscript, PHP, and, my favorite, PowerShell.

I switched to VS Code in late 2016 from PowerShell ISE. And, this year I started my GitHub presence and am venturing down the CI/CD path.

Hope you find my posts informative and entertaining.
